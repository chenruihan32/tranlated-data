<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">This work considers the problem of transmitting multiple
compressible sources over a network at minimum cost. The aim is to
find the optimal rates at which the sources should be compressed
and the network flows using which they should be transmitted so
that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We consider networks
with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem
is complicated by the fact that the description of the feasible
rate region of distributed source coding problems typically has a
number of constraints that is exponential in the number of sources.
This renders general purpose solvers inefficient. We present a
framework in which these problems can be solved efficiently by
exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupled with
dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the
subgradient method and the proximal bundle method.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years the emergence of sensor networks
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> as a new paradigm has introduced a number of
issues that did not exist earlier. Sensor networks have been
considered among other things by the military for battlefields, by
ecologists for habitat monitoring and even for extreme event
warning systems. These networks consist of tiny, low-power nodes
that are typically energy constrained. In general, they also have
low-computing power. Thus, designing efficient sensor networks
requires us to address engineering challenges that are
significantly different from the ones encountered in networks such
as the Internet. One unique characteristic of sensor networks is
that the data that is sensed by different sensor nodes and relayed
to a terminal is typically highly correlated. As an example
consider a sensor network deployed to monitor the temperature or
humidity levels in a forest. The temperature is not expected to
vary significantly over a small area. Therefore we do expect that
the readings corresponding to nearby sensors are quite correlated.
It is well-known that the energy consumed in transmission by a
sensor is quite substantial and therefore efficient low power
methods to transfer the data across the network are of interest.
This leads us to investigate efficient techniques for exploiting
the correlation of the data while transmitting it across the
network. There are multiple ways in which the correlation can be
exploited.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.ix1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The sensor nodes can communicate amongst themselves to
inform each other of the similarity of their data and then
transmit only as much data as is required. This comes at the cost
of the overhead of inter-sensor communication.</p>

<p id="S1.I1.ix2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The
sensors can choose to act independently and still attempt to
transmit the compressed data. This strategy is likely to be more
complicated from the receiver's point of view.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="S1.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Usually the terminal to which the data is transmitted has
significantly more resources (energy, computing power etc.). Thus,
the latter solution is more attractive from a network resource
efficiency point of view. The question of whether the distributed
compression of correlated sources can be as efficient as their
compression when the sources communicate with each other was first
considered and answered in the affirmative by Slepian and Wolf in
their famous paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. A number of authors
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> have investigated the
construction of coding techniques that achieve the Slepian-Wolf
bounds and also proposed their usage in sensor networks
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">New paradigms have also emerged recently in the area of network
information transfer. Traditionally information transfer over
networks has been considered via routing. Data packets from a
source node are allowed to be replicated and forwarded by the
intermediate nodes so that terminal nodes can satisfy their demands.
However, network coding offers an interesting alternative where
intermediate nodes in a network have the ability to forward
functions of incoming packets rather than copies of the packets.
The seminal work of Ahlswede et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> showed that network
coding achieves the capacity of single-source multiple-terminal
multicast where all the terminals are interested in receiving the
same set of messages from the source. This was followed by a
number of works that presented constructions and bounds for
multicast network codes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. More
recently, there has been work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> on
characterizing rate regions for arbitrary network connections
where the demands of the terminals can be arbitrary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Given these developments in two different fields, a natural
question to ask is how can one transmit compressible sources over
a network using network coding and whether this can be done
efficiently. This problem was
considered by Song and Yeung <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and Ho et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. They showed that as long as the minimum cuts between all nonempty
subsets of sources and a particular terminal were sufficiently
large, random linear network coding over the network followed by
appropriate decoding at the terminals achieves the Slepian-Wolf
bounds. The work of Ramamoorthy et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>
investigated the performance of separate source and network codes
and showed that separation does not hold in general. Both these papers only considered capacity constraints on the
edges of the network and did not impose any cost associated with
edge usage.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the networking context the problem of minimum cost network
flow has been widely investigated. Here, every edge in the network
has a cost per unit flow associated with it. The cost of a given
routing solution is the sum of the costs incurred over all the
links. The problem is one of finding network flows such that the
demand of the terminals is satisfied at minimum cost. This problem
has been very well investigated in the routing context <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.
The problem of minimum cost multicast using network coding was
considered by Lun et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and they presented
centralized and distributed solutions to it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we consider the problem of minimum cost joint rate
and flow allocation over a network that is utilized for
communicating compressible sources. We consider the scenario when
the compression is to be performed in a distributed manner. The
sources are not allowed to communicate with each other. The main issue with joint rate and flow allocation
is that typically the feasible rate region for the recovery of the
sources (e.g. the Slepian-Wolf region) is described by a number of
inequalities that is exponential in the number of sources. Thus, using a regular LP solver for solving the corresponding
linear programming problem will be inefficient. In our work, we only consider networks where the links are independent and where transmission up to the link's capacity is assumed to be error free. In general, the capacity region characterization of more complex networks such as wireless networks will need to take account issues such as interference. Moreover, it would introduce related issues such as scheduling. We do not consider these problems in this work.</p>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Problems of a similar flavor have been examined in several papers. Cristescu et al. considered the Networked Slepian-Wolf problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> and the case of lossy correlated data gathering over a network <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, but did not impose capacity constraints on the edges. Their solutions only considered very specific types of cost functions. The work of Li &amp; Ramamoorthy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> and Roumy &amp; Gesbert <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> considered a rate allocation under pairwise constraints on the distributed source code used for compression. The work of Liu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> considers a related problem, where they seek to minimize the total communication cost of a wireless sensor network with a single sink. They show that when the link communication costs are convex, then the usage of Slepian-Wolf coding and commodity flow routing is optimal. Moreover, they introduce the notion of distance entropy, and show that under certain situations the distance entropy is the minimum cost achieved by Slepian-Wolf coding and shortest path routing. They also propose hierarchical transmission schemes that exploit correlation among neighboring sensor nodes, and do not require global knowledge of the correlation structure. These schemes are shown to be order-optimal in specific situations. The main difference between our work and theirs, is the fact that we consider network coding and networks with multiple terminals. Moreover, in the case of general convex link cost functions, their focus is on showing that Slepian-Wolf coding and commodity flow routing is optimal. They do not consider the problem of actually finding the optimal flows and rates.</p>

the work of Yu et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>. However since our cost
functions only penalize the usage of links in the network, we are
effectively able to exploit the structure of the feasible rate
region to make our overall solution efficient. In addition we
explicitly derive the dual function and the corresponding update
equations for maximizing it based on the specific structure of the
rate region. Furthermore, we consider applications in network
coding and lifetime maximization in sensor networks that have not
been considered previously. In concurrent and independent work
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite> presented some approaches similar to ours (see also <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>, where the case of two sources is discussed). However
our approach has been applied to the minimum cost quadratic

<p id="S1.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A reviewer has pointed out that the problem of generalizing the Slepian-Wolf theorem to the network case was first considered by Han <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> in 1980. However, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> only networks with a single terminal were considered. In the single terminal case the corresponding flows can be supported by pure routing. Interestingly, in the same paper, Han references the work of Fujishige <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> that studies the optimal independent flow problem (this was also pointed by the same reviewer). Fujishige's work considers a network flow problem that has polymatroidal <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>]</cite> constraints for the source values and the terminal values. In particular, if there is only one terminal, then this algorithm provides an efficient solution to the minimum cost Slepian-Wolf problem over a network. However, it is unclear whether it can be extended to the case of multiple terminals and network coding.

<p id="S3.p3.6" class="ltx_p">The work of Csiszár <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> showed that linear codes are
sufficient to approach the Slepian-Wolf (henceforth S-W) bounds
arbitrarily closely.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Note that the original S-W problem does not consider
the sources to be communicating with the terminal (or more
generally multiple terminals) over a network. Furthermore, there
are no capacity constraints on the edges connecting the sources
and the terminal. In situations such as sensor networks, where the
sensor nodes are typically energy-constrained, we would expect the
source nodes to be in communication with the terminal node over a
network that is both capacity and cost-limited. Capacity
constraints may be relatively strict since a significant amount of
power is consumed in transmissions. The costs of using different
links could be used to ensure that a certain part of the network
is not overused resulting in non-uniform depletion of resources.
Thus the problem of transmitting correlated data over a network
with capacity constraints at minimum cost is of interest. We
define an instance of the S-W problem over a network by

grows exponentially with the number of sources. For regular LP
solvers the time complexity scales with the number of constraints
and variables. Thus, using a regular LP solver is certainly not
time-efficient. Moreover even storing the constraints consumes
exponential space and thus using a regular LP solver would also be
space-inefficient. In the sequel we present efficient techniques
for solving this problem.</p>

exponentially with the number of sources. However, one is guaranteed that the LP solver will terminate in a finite number of steps eventually. Our proposed algorithm uses the subgradient method with step sizes such that the recovered solution will converge to the optimal as the number of iterations go to infinity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. In general, it does not seem possible to claim convergence in a finite number of steps for this method. A discussion around convergence issues of the subgradient method can be found in Chap. 6 of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>. We point out that in practice, we found the algorithms to converge well. Note also that even the description of the LP requires space that increases very quickly, therefore using the LP formulation becomes impractical even with a moderate number of sources.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In general, the problem of
transmitting compressible sources over a network need not have the
requirement of lossless reconstruction of the sources. This maybe
due to multiple reasons. The terminal may be satisfied with a low
resolution reconstruction of the sources to save on network
resources or lossless reconstruction may be impossible because of
the nature of sources. If a source is continuous then perfect
reconstruction would theoretically require an infinite number of
bits. Thus the problem of lossy reconstruction has also been an
active area of research. In this section we shall consider the
quadratic Gaussian CEO problem <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> over
a network. We start by outlining the original problem considered
by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. We then present the minimum cost
formulation in the network context and present efficient solutions
to it.</p>

essentially the Slepian-Wolf theorem holds even in the network
case with multiple terminals i.e. any rate vector that can be
obtained by joint coding can be obtained by distributed coding
even when there are multiple terminals. However, an analogous
result in the case of the quadratic Gaussian CEO problem does not
exist. Furthermore, the rate region for the quadratic Gaussian CEO
problem over a general network is unknown. As a simple example, we
may have a network where two source nodes are connected to a
common intermediate node. The intermediate node can then combine
the quantized observations from these source nodes to generate a
new quantized observation such that a lower rate is possible. Thus
the rate region given by the classical Gaussian CEO problem may
not hold as the two codewords may be fused to produce a new
codeword that enables lower rate transmission.</p>

Thus in this problem we shall not consider network coding. For the
second issue we assume that the network operates in a separate
compression and information transfer mode. The set of source nodes
quantize their observations as they would in the original
quadratic Gaussian CEO problem. After this source coding step, the
network ignores any data correlations and routes the data as
though it were incompressible. In general this separation of the
compression and the information transfer is suboptimal, however it
is likely to be a simple way of operating the network.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.2" class="ltx_p">We now consider the problem of maximizing the lifetime of a sensor
network when the terminal node needs to be able to reconstruct the
data at a particular distortion level (related problems were
studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>). This problem is important in
the context of sensor networks where nodes are typically
battery-limited and are sensing correlated phenomena that need to
be reconstructed at the terminal node. It has been studied in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>]</cite> when the rates of the sensors are fixed. As

approximate linear programs that were obtained by strengthening

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We considered the problem of jointly
allocating rates and flows at minimum cost for distributed source
coding problems over a network. In particular, we considered (a)
the Slepian-Wolf problem, (b) the minimum cost quadratic Gaussian
CEO problem and (c) the problem of maximizing network lifetime
when a source needs to be reconstructed within a quadratic
distortion constraint. These problems are of interest in domains
such as sensor networks where the data that is sensed by different
sensors is typically highly correlated. The feasible rate region of distributed source coding problems is typically
specified by a number of inequalities that is exponential in the
number of sources that makes these problems hard to solve. We
presented an approach based on dual decomposition that uses the
special structure of the rate regions to efficiently compute the
dual function. Finally, we demonstrated approaches for maximizing
the dual function using the subgradient algorithm and the proximal
bundle algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">It would be interesting to investigate algorithms along the lines of those considered by Fujishige <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> (that do not use dual decomposition), for the problems considered in this paper and study whether they have lower complexity.
In all the problems we considered, we were able to decouple the rate allocations from the flow allocations. This essentially happens because the two sets of variables have a limited interaction via simple linear inequalities. As pointed out by a reviewer there may be other problems that may lend themselves to this kind of decomposition, where the interaction between these variables is more complex.</p>
