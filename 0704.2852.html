<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Future nano-scale electronics built up from an Avogadro number of
components needs efficient, highly scalable, and robust means of
communication in order to be competitive with traditional silicon
approaches. In recent years, the Networks-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm
emerged as a promising solution to interconnect challenges in
silicon-based electronics. Current NoC architectures are either highly
regular or fully customized, both of which represent implausible
assumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular
electronics that are generally assumed to have a high degree of
irregularity and imperfection. Here, we pragmatically and
experimentally investigate important design trade-offs and properties
of an irregular, abstract, yet physically plausible 3D small-world
interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chip
paradigms. We vary the framework’s key parameters, such as the
connectivity, the number of switch nodes, the distribution of long-
versus short-range connections, and measure the network’s relevant
communication characteristics. We further explore the robustness against
link failures and the ability and efficiency to solve a simple toy
problem, the synchronization task. The results confirm that (1)
computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and disruptive
computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and (2)
that 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law
decaying distribution of shortcut lengths are physically plausible and
have major advantages over local 2D and 3D regular topologies.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">It is generally expected that without disruptive new technologies, the
ever-increasing computing performance (commonly known as Moore’s law
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">moore65 </a></cite>) and the storage capacity achieved with existing
technologies will eventually reach a plateau <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">kish02 </a></cite>. However,
there is a lack of consensus on what type of technology and computing
architecture holds most promises to keep up the current pace of
progress. Among the most contemplated future and emerging technologies
are quantum computers, molecular electronics, nano-electronics,
optical computers, and quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA). In this
paper, we will primarily focus on self-assembled nano-scale
electronics based on nanowires or nanotubes because these fabrication
technologies have become quite mature on the physical and device
level. It is, however, still unclear how to develop higher-level
computational architectures in a reliable way, although a number of
promising approaches have been explored in detail (e.g.,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">Heath98 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">patwardhan06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">dehon03 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">tour02 </a></cite>) As Chen et
al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">chen03 </a></cite> state, “[i]n order to realize functional
nano-electronic circuits, researchers need to solve three problems:
invent a nanoscale device that switches an electric current on and
off; build a nanoscale circuit that controllably links very large
numbers of these devices with each other and with external systems in
order to perform memory and/or logic functions; and design an
architecture that allows the circuits to communicate with other
systems and operate independently on their lower-level details.”</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Building a scalable computing architecture on top of a potentially
very unreliable physical substrate, such as for example molecular
electronics, is a challenging task, which is guided by a number of
major trade-offs in the design space <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">stan03 </a></cite>, such as the number
and the characteristics of the resources available, the required
performance, the energy consumption, and the reliability. The lack of
systematic understanding of these issues and of clear design
methodologies makes the process still more of an art than of a
scientific endeavor and the appearance of novel and non-standard
physical computing devices (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">tour02 </a></cite>) generally only
aggravates these difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, the importance of interconnects on electronic chips
has outrun the importance of transistors as a dominant factor of
performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">meindl03 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">ho01 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">davis01 </a></cite>. The reasons are twofold: (1)
the transistor switching speed for traditional silicon is much faster
than the average wire delays and (2) the required chip area for
interconnects has dramatically increased. The ITRS roadmap
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">itrs2003 </a></cite> lists a number of critical challenges for
interconnects and states that “[i]t is now widely conceded that
technology alone cannot solve the on-chip global interconnect problem
with current design methodologies.” The major challenges are related
to delays of non-scalable global interconnects and reliability in
general, which leads to the observation that simple scaling will no
longer satisfy performance requirements as feature sizes continue to
shrink <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">ho01 </a></cite>.</p>

certain class of irregular and physically plausible 3D interconnect
fabrics, which are likely to be easily and cheaply implementable by
self-assembling either nanowires or nanotubes. We will vary the
framework’s key parameters, such as the connectivity, the number of
switch nodes, the distribution of long- versus short-range
connections, and measure the network’s relevant communication
characteristics and the robustness against failures. Further, we will
compare its performance with regular and nearest-neighbor connected 2D
and 3D cellular-automata-like interconnect fabrics. We will also
evaluate and compare the performance of a simple task that is
frequently used in the cellular automata community, the
synchronization task.</p>

believe that the results will help to make important design decisions
for future bottom-up self-assembled computing architectures. The
question of how much interconnect we need and how one can efficiently
build—or rather self-assemble—it, is a very important question,
not only for chip design and future molecular electronics in

network topology. The rewiring procedure establishes “shortcuts” in
the network, which significantly lower the average distance (i.e., the
number of edges to traverse) between any pair of nodes. In the

needs to be taken into account, a perspective that recently gained

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The topic of interconnect networks for computers and chips is vast and
complex. Here, we’ll give a brief—and certainly
incomplete—overview on communications on chips. From a bird’s eye
view, the main challenge of interconnect fabrics consists in
transferring data between two points of the chip with a minimal
latency, minimal energy consumption, and maximal reliability. This job
can obviously be done in a wide variety of ways. Compared to
computer-to-computer networks, one has to generally deal with a more
restrictive set of resources and with more constraints to
consider. The balance between communication and computation is guided
by numerous design trade-offs and is key to performance. For example,
a set of fast processors is useless if you cannot get enough data to
them on time.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Traditional VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) design uses an ad-hoc
and monolithic communication fabric that connects different resources
(such as for example the memory and the ALU) on the chip together by
dedicated wires. With increasing system complexity and the continuing
miniaturization of the technology, radically new interconnect
approaches will be necessary if we want to sustain the current pace of
progress <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">meindl03 </a></cite>. Two main factors potentially limit
performance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">ho01 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">davis01 </a></cite>: (1) the miniaturization of wires,

wires are now more important than transistors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">meindl03 </a></cite>, and (2)
global wires that communicate signals across the whole chip increase
delays and therefore limit the system scalability. The 2005 ITRS
roadmap <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">itrs2005 </a></cite> (and the 2006 update) lists a more detailed
number of critical challenges for interconnects. In recent years, true
3D architectures and associated design methodologies have emerged,
which offer an attractive option to address some of the current
interconnect challenges <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">xie06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">ahn06 </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, networks-on-chip (NoC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">demicheli06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">benini02 </a></cite>
have been proposed as a promising solution to address the on-chip
communication challenges and to cope with the increasing communication
requirements. The basic idea behind this paradigm is that the
different modules on the chip (e.g., IP cores) are interlinked by a
bus-like communication network with programmable switch blocks that
support packet-oriented traffic. Thus, NoC architectures decouple the
communication fabric from the processing and storage elements
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">benini02 </a></cite> and provide a more modular view of the system, which
allows to better master complexity of large-scale systems, to
decompose it into independent sub-systems, and to keep things
flexible. The additional communication fabric obviously results in an
overhead of area and energy dissipation, which the designer has to
consider in addition to all other design trade-offs. The overhead
largely depends on the connectivity, the number of switch blocks,
their complexity, and the number of possible repeaters. Pande et
al. provide some estimates for their framework <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">pande05 </a></cite>.</p>

architecture between functional and communication blocks, such as for
example local and regular, fat-tree, hypercube, or irregular and

examples). Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), for example, offer
a regular arrangement of programmable logic blocks that are
interconnected by a programmable communication fabric, which
introduces a great degree of freedom for the application designer.
However, once the NoC topology is selected, the only remaining degree
of freedom is the routing strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In the following, we will make use of the NoC paradigm in combination
with nature-inspired 3D network topologies for our explorative
framework. Very recently, other researchers investigated the idea of
inserting long range connections to otherwise regular
networks-on-chip. Ogras et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">ogras06 </a></cite> showed that a
significant reduction in the average packet latency can be achieved by
superposing a few long-range links to a standard mesh network. In
their approach, the links are however not inserted at random but where
they are most useful. Oshida and Ihara <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">oshida06 </a></cite> investigate the
performance of a scale-free network-on-chip topologies. Their findings
show that short latencies and a low packet loss ratio can be
achieved. The parallel processing community has also looked into
improving large-scale multi-computer interconnects by adding shortcuts
to bypass nodes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">loucif99 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">dally91 </a></cite>. Fukś and Lawniczak

generally how the introduction of additional random links influences
the performance of computer networks. For all these approaches, the
performance strongly depends on the routing algorithm and whether it
is able to efficiently use the provided “shortcuts” in the networks
while avoiding congestion at the same time.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Once a topology is chosen and fixed, the only free parameter available
is essentially the routing strategy, which plays a crucial role for
the overall system performance. There exists a large number of
different routing strategies and flavors, which allow to send packets
along pre-specified or dynamically chosen paths in a given network
from a source to a destination. Whether throughput or latency or any
other property needs to be maximized, highly depends on the
application. In general, an ideal routing algorithm is adaptive,
decentralized, robust, and guarantees quality-of-service (QoS) within
well defined bounds.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we deal with packet routing only and the switch nodes do
therefore have to know where to route a packet that they receive. The
path information can be obtained dynamically or statically, based on
the available information on the network’s topology. Shortest path
routing is frequently used, but it’s not necessary the best routing
strategy <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">yan06 </a></cite> since congestion has to be taken into account.</p>

has also been shown that small-world and scale-free networks offer
great communication characteristics, are efficient to navigate

large-scale systems where global path information is either not
available or too costly to store in each node.</p>

<div id="S3.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Here, we are more interested in exploring the extrema than to use any
complicated and highly optimized routing algorithm. We use two main
routing strategies: (1) shortest path routing and (2) random
wandering. Shortest path routing is optimal if the traffic is low and
no congestion occurs, but every node needs to store a routing table
that can get considerably large for large networks. In random
wandering, the switch node that receives a message simply sends it to
a randomly chosen neighbor. This is very simple to implement and
robust against link and node failures, but very inefficient for larger
system sizes. We have also explored ant routing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">caro98 </a></cite> as an
alternative, which essentially allows to build shortest paths in a
decentralized manner by the messages (i.e., the “ants”) themselves.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">There exists an abundance of abstract computing models that are either
hard or impossible (e.g., when infinite resources or time is involved)
to physically realize. Building computers is about hijacking the
underlying material in order to make it do the things we want. Today,
the vast majority of fabrication processes is top-down oriented and
given a computing architecture, the goal is to successfully realize
it, for example by using silicon-based electronics. However, with the
ongoing miniaturization and the constant need for more computing
power, there has been an increasing interest in bottom-up assembling
techniques and disruptive new computing concepts and methodologies.
Especially self-assembling molecular electronics, based for example on
nanowires or nanotubes, bears unique challenges and opportunities for
new paradigms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Despite important progress, the fabrication of ordered 3D hierarchical
nano-structures remains very challenging <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhang06 </a></cite>. Here, we
argue that because of fewer physical constraints, computing
architectures that are “assembled” in a largely random manner, are
easier and cheaper to build than highly regular architectures, such as
crossbars or cellular-automata-like assemblies, which usually require
a perfect or almost perfect establishment of the
connections. Self-assembly, for example, is particularly well suited
for building random structures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib65" title="" class="ltx_ref">zhirnov01 </a></cite>. Power-law
connection-length distributions have been observed in many systems
created through self-organization, such as the human cortex or the
Internet, and they can be considered “physically realizable”
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">petermann06 </a></cite>. Such topologies evolve naturally in Nature,
essentially because of the cost associated with long distance
connections, which prevents a uniform wiring probability over all
nodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There is very little work about computing architectures with irregular
assemblies of connections and components. Tour et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">tour02 </a></cite>,
for example, explored the possibility of computing with randomly
assembled, easily realizable molecular switches, that are only locally
interconnected, however. On the other hand, Hogg et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">hogg06 </a></cite>
present an approach to build reliable circuits by self-assembly with
some random variation in the connection location. At the exception of
a few researchers (e.g., <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">patwardhan06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">lawson06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">tour02 </a></cite>), the
vast majority working in the field of nano-scale electronics tries to
build regular structures, which allow for a more or less
straightforward mapping of higher-level computing
architectures. Computing with highly irregularly assembled physical
substrates is undoubtedly a new and disruptive paradigm. The main
question we would like to address to some extent in this section is
whether and how the framework as described above could be physically
implemented.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Designing nanoscale interconnects is guided by a number of major and
dependent trade-offs: (1) the number of long(er)-distance connections,
(2) the physical plausibility, and (3) the efficiency of
communication. Since the fabrication of nano-scale computing
architectures tends to be very challenging, we opt for a
fabrication-friendly approach and will try to live with what we can
currently build. Although we are unable to provide experimental
results at this point, plausible approaches for physical realizations
shall be briefly sketched here. Preliminary experiments with both
nanowires and nanotubes are currently underway at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We believe that a random multitude would be best realized in a hybrid
way today, where the processing and switch nodes are for example made
of current (nanoscale) silicon. Since we are focusing on the
interconnections here, we do not further specify the characteristics
of these nodes. Our only intention is to keep both the computation and
the routing as simple as possible to minimize the node’s complexity.
The interconnect fabric would then be gradually self-assembled using
either nanowires or nanotubes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">hu99 </a></cite>. We imagine that in a first
step, both the processing and the switch nodes would either be
randomly placed in a scaffolding structure or be submerged in some
kind of fluid, similar to the self-assembly of nanowires from a
solution <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">cheng05 </a></cite>. Each processing and switch node will have a
limited number of seed points, where either nanowires or nanotubes
could connect to or grow out by, for example, a self-catalytic growth
process. The wires would grow in random directions and eventually make
contact with another switch or processing node. The growth could be
guided by additional scaffolding structures or for example by
magnetical and electrical fields. Ye et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">ye06 </a></cite>, for example,
present an approach for the directed assembly by means of
electrodeposition or vapor deposition. As an alternative to directly
growing wires from seed points on the nodes, one could also imagine to
pre-fabricate the wires and then to connect them in a second step to
the nodes, for example while being immersed in a solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.SS5.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">To obtain a specific power-law distribution of connection lengths, and
thus to obtain a small-world topology as described above, one could
imagine to grow different wires with different probabilities, whose
lengths follow a power-law distribution. Alternatively, if the wires
directly grow out of the nodes and randomly connect to neighboring
nodes, we hypothesize that it is possible to obtain a desired
distribution as a function of the Euclidean distance between the nodes
by imposing restrictions on the wire growth lengths. However, physical
wire growth models or experimental results would be necessary to
further investigate this option. Note also that current nanowires
tend to be rather short because of a high resistance and the
probability of breaks, which will naturally limit the number of
long-distance connections.</p>

before, scalability is a critical issue for nano-scale systems because
it is generally very easy to build systems that involve huge numbers

fabric doesn’t allow to efficiently send data across such an assembly,
it will be impossible to solve tasks efficiently and thus to stay
competitive with conventional design approaches.</p>

The fixed
CA topologies are shown for comparison. However, there is a trade-off
between the number of hops and the throughput a network can handle. A
low number of switch nodes limits the throughput, which we cannot
illustrate here because we have chosen a low traffic injection rate
that avoids jamming. Thus, depending on what the network needs to be
optimized for (i.e., lower number of hops, throughput, short average
path length, etc.), one can make the appropriate choice for the number
of switch nodes. Obviously, the amount of hardware resources and the
volume required will also come into play in reality.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We can conclude that there are no “optimal” values for connectivity,
the number of switch nodes, and the number of virtual
channels. Instead, choosing the right values is a matter of dependent
trade-offs in the design space. Local connections are very interesting
from an implementational point of view, but offer reduced global
communication characteristics only, which directly affects the efficiency
of problem solving (see also Section <a href="#S4.SS5" title="IV.5 Experiment 5: Solving a Simple Task ‣ IV Experiments ‣ Nature-Inspired Interconnects for Self-Assembled Large-Scale Network-on-Chip Designs" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV.5</span></a>). Adding a few
long(er)-distance connections proportional to the distance between the
nodes is physically plausible and greatly improves the overall system
performance as well as the robustness, as we will see in the next
section.</p>

<p id="S4.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this last experiment, we are interested in evaluating the
performance of solving a simple problem, which is well-known in the
area of cellular automata (CA): the <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">synchronization task</span>. This
“global” task is essentially trivial to solve if one has a global
view on the entire system (i.e., if one has access to the state of all
nodes at the same instant in time), but it is non-trivial to solve for
locally connected cellular automata or random boolean networks
(RBNs). Although it is commonly called a “toy problem,” the
synchronization task has actually various real-world applications,
such as for example in sensor networks, where one cannot assume global
synchronization and global signals, and thus special mechanisms are
required <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">li06 </a></cite>.</p>

locally interconnected topologies. However, the frameworks and
assumptions used in each approach are somehow different and sometimes
not straightforward to compare. The results of our framework merely
confirm what has been found theoretically elsewhere and in our two
previous experiments, namely that the excellent communication
characteristics (i.e., short characteristic path length, the small
latency, etc.) also helps to efficiently solve tasks, especially tasks
which require a lot of global communication. From an evolutionary
perspective, this also seems the reason why most natural networks,
e.g. the brain <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">hellwig00 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">egueluz05 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">sporns04 </a></cite>, have evolved with
the small-world and scale-free property. The relationship between
efficient problem solving and interconnection topologies has naturally
also preoccupied the parallel computing community since its beginning

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have experimentally investigated in a pragmatic way several
relevant metrics of both regular and irregular, realistic
system-on-chip-like computing architectures for self-assembled
nanoscale electronics, namely 2D and 3D local-neighborhood as well as
irregularly build small-world interconnects with different
distributions of long-distance connections. The small-world
architectures with a power-law decaying distribution of shortcut
lengths investigated in our framework are both physically plausible,
could likely be built very economically by self-assembling processes,
possess great communication characteristics, and are robust against link
failures. While regular and local-neighborhood interconnects are
easier and more economical to build than interconnects with lots of
global or semi-global long-distance connections, we have seen in the
previous section that they are not as efficient for global
communication, which is very important and directly affects how
efficient problems can be solved with such architectures. Small-world
networks with a uniform distribution of long-distance connections or
pure Erdös-Rényi random networks, on the other hand, are not
physically plausible because one has to assume an increasing wiring
cost with distance. As our results have shown by means of a
simplistic, yet realistic framework, small-world topologies with a
power-law decaying distribution of shortcut lengths offer a unique
balance between performance, robustness, physical plausibility, and
fabrication friendliness. In addition, it has been shown that adaptive
routing—which we have not explored in detail here—is very
efficient on small-world power-law graphs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">kleinberg00 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">wang06 </a></cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We believe that computation in random self-assemblies of components
and interconnections (see e.g.,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite"><a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">tour02 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">lawson06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">hogg06 </a>; <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">patwardhan06 </a></cite>) is a highly appealing
paradigm, both from the perspective of fabrication as well as
performance and robustness. This is obviously a radically new
technological and conceptual approach with many open questions. For
example, there are essentially no methodologies and tools that would
allow (1) to map an arbitrary computing architecture or a logical
system on a randomly assembled physical substrate, (2) to do arbitrary
computations with such an assembly, and (3) to systematically analyze
performance and robustness within a rigorous mathematical
framework. There are also many open questions regarding the
self-assembling fabrication techniques, which will need to be further
explored in the future.</p>
