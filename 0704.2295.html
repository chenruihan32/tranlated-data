<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">A secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to a remote server when even the users’ inputs are not hidden from an adversary. Recently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA Conference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently process an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the workload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on textual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of automated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the results. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the relationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably “quantified” security guarantees based on our model.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Suppose a student wishes to write a confidential email to disclose the information of a leaked out exam paper to his friend. Using a secure email client the student writes down an email, sends it and logs out. The email shall be encrypted and would only be viewable by the recipient once he logs in to check the email. How can the student be sure that the email was sent securely and no one could learn anything apart from the intended recipient? The answer relies on the weakest security link: the password. Little did the student know that his computer was being key-logged <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. There was a hidden camera looking at the student’s every move. His fellow student also shoulder surfed on the password. Even if no one saw the mail being written, they could log on later to view the sent mail box. It turns out that no matter how secure the email client was, it only served its purpose until the password was not compromised.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Similar situation occurs when one inputs PIN numbers on ATMs. We could use biometrics instead of passwords or pin numbers. But biometric data is only secure unless the biometric information is kept confidential and the equipment has not been tampered. So, are these mechanisms unsecure or useless? They certainly aren’t. They were designed with certain assumptions in mind: The passwords selected by the user should be truly random strings of a suitable length; the pin numbers selected by the user should be truly random 4-digit numbers; the user has the responsibility to hide her input from peeping eyes. It has been an interesting topic of research in cryptography to devise authentication protocols that meet the security reequirements even when the above mentioned assumptions do not hold. This highly vulnerable security environment has been termed as the “naked human in a glass house” model in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>, although the first protocol constructed to be secure in this model was by Matsumoto <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. We shall call such protocols as “Human Identification Protocols” or HIPs in short following the terminology in literature. A lot of human identification protocols have been proposed in literature with the goal of ease of “human execution” in mind. The protocols should take roughly the same amount of time as a password based protocol takes. Researchers have tried to construct protocols that are secure and require little or no computation on the human’s part. This indeed is a very hard goal to achieve and reflects through the fact that there are not a lot of proposed human identification protocols over the years.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The situation, however, is not as bad as it seems. Humans possess good cognitive abilities. We can recall a previously viewed image with a very high probability when presented to us again. We do not need to memorise all the details of the picture. This has led to the use of graphics as essential ingredients of human identification protocols. Proposed identification protocols can be implemented with a graphical implementation. For example, instead of memorizing the string 00101, we can display five pictures, each time, where the third and the fifth picture is shown to the user apriori as the user’s secret pictures. We could go a step further and use the things that an image describes to build human identification protocols. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> we proposed that instead of using pictures just as memory aids, we can use their internal structure in some way to construct a human identification protocol. The secret could be one of the concepts that the picture satisfies. It was conjectured that it would be hard even for a human adversary to find the secret. However, no exact quantification of this hardness was given. While the hardness of breaking the protocol is clearly evident against automated adversaries (computer programs programmed to defeat the protocol), the security against “human adversaries” needs more attention. This study aims to enhance the work proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> by answering some of the open problems and moves a step further in trying to quantify the hardness of the underlying problem. We address the following issues:</p>

<p id="S1.p3.2" class="ltx_p">Our study will deal with passive adversaries only. The reason being that if we deal with active adversaries in the protocols, then we might require the human user to send some random challenges to the remote server in order to authenticate it as well. This generation of random challenges requires an extra amount of computation from the human user’s part, and might deem the protocols impractical. This is left as a future work.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>Related Work</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first work on human identification dates back to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. Since then a lot of other schemes have been proposed in literature <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. Some of them were broken in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. While most of them involve some numerical calculations like <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> and the HB protocol<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, they can be implemented using some graphical interface employing pictures as memory aids. We can categorized the human identification protocols into two broad categories: Protocols built to be secure against general eavesdropping adversaries and protocols secure against only “guessing adversaries” i.e. Adversaries who do not see the user’s input and hence try to guess the secret or impersonate the user without any apriori knowledge. Protocols mentioned so far fall in the first category. They have a drawback, however, that they involve extra computation from the user. As an example, in the HB protocol <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, the user is required to compute bit-wise binary multiplication for some number of bits in every iteration. This may not seem much but to obtain a higher level of security, the number of computations increase significantly.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In the second category, the most well known example is the traditional password based authentication system. Others include purely graphical schemes like DeJa Vu<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>,Passface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, Point &amp; Click <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> that require little or no numerical computation whatsoever. The basic theme of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> is to present the user a series of pictures, a subset of which are the secret pictures. The user is authenticated if its selection of the secret pictures among the given set of pictures is correct. On the other hand, in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> the user is authenticated if it clicks on the correct secret location in the given picture. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite> works similarly by letting the user draw the secret symbol or figure on a display device. Evidently, these purely graphical schemes are not secure against “peeping” attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. Anyone observing the actions of the user can find out the secret in no time. For a detailed account of all the schemes, see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In our previous work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, we proposed to use internal properties of images as secrets. After a secret has been chosen, pictures which satisfy the properties were presented randomly with the pictures that do not satisfy the property. The user has to answer the pictures according to the secret property. It was conjectured that finding out the secret property is a hard problem for adversaries. For automated adversaries, this follows immediately from the definition of CAPTCHAs<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. But for human adversaries, this hardness is difficult to prove. In this paper, we have tried to quantify this hardness and tried to answer some of the open questions described above.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>The Main Idea</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Consider the picture of a magic square shown in Figure 1. How many things does the picture represent? A simple glance at it can reveal a lot of things: a magic square, a square, nine small squares, digits, black, white, the digit 4, the digit 2, line(s), the right angle etc. It is amazing how much information does a rather simple looking picture contain. We call each piece of this information as a feature. We can take one of these features and construct a question out of it. For example: Does the picture contain a rectangle?. This question is shared as a secret between the server and the user. After that, a series of pictures can be presented to the user such that with probability 1/2 they satisfy the question and with probability 1/2 they don’t. The user has to scan the picture and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ accordingly. How about the adversary? The adversary would like to know the secret feature. The best way to do it is to extract all features in the pictures presented to the user and then do intersection (if user’s answer is ‘yes’) or difference (if user’s answer is ‘no’) to narrow down the number of possible secret features.</p>

Obviously, it is almost impossible to write a computer program which given a picture can filter out all the features that picture describes considering the enormous size of the set of all features. This immediately implies the need of human intervention. So, what could be the best strategy to find out the hidden feature? One way is to have a cursory glance at the pictures and see if there is something common between the pictures. A more efficient way is to find out all the features in the pictures, and then check which features are common between the pictures. But once the features have been extracted, one could make a program that would automatically filter out the common features. Thus we will only be concerned with the workload on the human adversary which amounts to finding out all the features in the pictures until a single common feature is found. Our analysis will try to quantify the complexity of our proposed schemes based on the workload on human adversary using the mentioned approach.

<p id="S4.SS1.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This protocol is simple and practical. However, there is a big disadvantage. Namely, the user is sending its answers in the clear. An adversary thus knows the “correct” answer to all the pictures shown to the user. This makes the life of the adversary a bit easier since it can have a glance at the pictures to find out the common secret feature. We would like to somehow “hide” the answer sequence, thus making it hard for the adversary to guess the secret feature. The next protocol attempts to do that. This protocol was the original protocol presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.SSS0.Px1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Even though this protocol does have an advantage over the basic protocol in the sense that the correct answer sequence is shuffled, it seems hard to construct a method so as to hide the answer sequence completely with not too much effort on the user’s part. It not only adds extra burden while answering the pictures, it also slows down the process. Secondly, in the two schemes proposed, there is a big question of practicality.
How to automatically generate those pictures? We conjecture that it is hard to write a program that can extract all the features from the given features. But how about the problem of generating or finding out images satisfying a given question automatically? This might not be possible for all questions. In the next scheme we try to create a protocol that can automatically generate instances.</p>

This again is not a worry as the adversary does not know which parameters are chosen. But the most important concern is: How much do the distorted images of texts and numbers describe? Unfortunately, the full spectrum of features described by a distorted image of a word from a dictionary is not much more than a natural image. Therefore, we should conclude that although the above scheme puts some autonomy in the challenge generation process, it is not as secure as the ones which contain natural images in terms of the workload on the adversary. Details follow in Section VI.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.2" class="ltx_p">In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> we proposed that we can have a group of questions as a secret connected by any combination of logical connectives, like AND, OR and NOT. However, we should not have greater than a certain number of logically connected features, because otherwise the workload on the legitimate user increases considerably. We could safely use a group of 3 or less questions. The adversary’s algorithm described above and in the analysis will not work in this case, unless all the questions are connected by the logical AND. There are still ways to go around this, the adversary this time around looks for inconsistent features in the picture and eliminates them in each iteration. More precisely, the adversary’s task is to find a boolean function consisting of 3 or less literals that satisfies the truth assignments of all the literals. More precisely, let <math id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\bf{V}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">𝐕</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐕</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p1.1.m1.1c">{\bf{V}}</annotation></semantics></math> denote the matrix consisting of features extracted from the pictures. Each column of this matrix represents the absence or presence of a feature in the corresponding picture. If the adversary also knows the answer vector <math id="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="{\bf{a}}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">𝐚</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝐚</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS4.p1.2.m2.1c">{\bf{a}}</annotation></semantics></math>, then its job is to find a boolean function satisfying the mapping. We could use multiple questions in any three of the above protocols. The basic protocol is then reduced trivially to the problem of finding the boolean function defined above. The enhanced protocol however becomes a bit more tricky, since we do not know the exact evaluation of the expression. The practical scheme also becomes hard as we do not know the literals being used in the evaluation of the boolean function.
There can be two variants of this protocol; The basic protocol and the enhanced protocol. Obviously, the adversary can eliminate inconsistent features in the basic protocol easily as it does not involve any random replies. However, if we use the enhanced protocol with questions connected by logical operators, we can make the adversary’s task harder as there would be random bits in the answer sequence as well.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We did a few experiments in order to get an idea about the efficiency of our scheme. The experimental stage consisted of two main experiments: The first one was carried out to see how many distinct features can be extracted from a given picture; The second one was to check whether it is easy for a human user to tell whether a given feature is present in a picture or not. For the first experiment, we presented the image in Figure 1 to ten participants (all computer science graduate school students). Each one of them were asked to write down as many features as they believed the picture contained. A commulative total of 42 distinct features were extracted by the participants altogether, not counting the multiplicity of some features (such as the digits 1,2,…,9 are written together). These features are given in the Table 1 along with their frequency which means the number of participants who wrote down the corresponding feature:

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Once the features were collected, they were shown to three separate individuals not present in the first experiment. They were shown the picture and asked to answer whether the given list of features found by the participants in the first experiment were present in the picture or not. Their responses are shown in the column labeled ”Freq and Res” where a ✔represents that the corresponding participant believed the feature to be present in the picture. Not surprisingly, the features with the higher frequencies were answered correctly by all three users. On the other hand, some of the single frequency features were also answered correctly by all three users. The ones with indifferent answers are those that require a ‘keen’ eye, e.g. “hook”.
These experiments show that even a simple picture as the one shown in Figure 1 can have a lot of features, majority of which are very easy to answer but not so easy to extract. There can still be a lot more features present in the picture; one such example is ”‘one side of a rubik’s cube”’.
This survey gives us some guidelines while choosing the pictures and/or secret questions:</p>

The purpose of analysis is to find out the strength of the protocol if one of these secrets is leaked out. For the first part, let’s assume that the adversary somehow found out the hidden permutation <math id="S6.p1.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sigma" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.3.m3.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.3.m3.1.1" xref="S6.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml">σ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.3.m3.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.3.m3.1.1">𝜎</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.3.m3.1c">\sigma</annotation></semantics></math> but not the secret question. Since the adversary knows the hidden permutation, it knows exactly which questions are being answered and which one are being answered randomly. Thus the adversary can neglect the randomly answered pictures and use the pictures with correct answers to look for the secret question. Thus this transforms to the Basic Protocol in a straightforward manner.</p>

Over the years researchers have tried to construct efficient Human identification protocols which are secure against passive or active adversaries. However, the protocols run short in terms of efficiency and security. One such protocol was proposed by us in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and its security was based on the “conjectured difficulty” of obtaining the secret after observing some authentication sessions. In this paper, we have extended the work by giving some candidate alternative protocols, finding the exact harndess of these protocols in terms of the effort required by the human adversary as well as giving a detailed analysis of the protocol proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. A brief survey regarding the number of possible features in an image was also carried out. Our results show that a practical implementation of the protocol might be feasile provided we are against a resource constrained human adversary.</p>
</div>
<div id="S8.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S8.p2.1" class="ltx_p">A notable future line of work is to device a similar protocol secure against active adversaries. This might involve sending challenges to the server by the human user similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. However, it remains an open problem whether we can fine tune the protocols so as to make them secure against active adversaries without increasing the workload on legitimate users. Another direction of future work is to come up with a different model for the distribution of features in images found on the web. This might give a close to realistic quantification of the workload on the adversary.</p>
