<p id="id8.id1" class="ltx_p">Distributed estimation based on measurements from multiple wireless
sensors is investigated. It is assumed that a group of sensors
observe the same quantity in independent additive observation noises
with possibly different variances. The observations are transmitted
using amplify-and-forward (analog) transmissions over non-ideal
fading wireless channels from the sensors to a fusion center, where
they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed quantity.
Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by
the fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first
discussed, where the system performance is analyzed by introducing
the concept of estimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is
shown that there is an achievable diversity gain on the order of the
number of sensors. The optimal power allocation strategies are then
considered for two cases: minimum distortion under power
constraints; and minimum power under distortion constraints. In the
first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors, <em id="id8.id1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>,
sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive
power gain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here,
the adaptive power gain is similar to the array gain achieved in
Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when
channel conditions are known to the transmitter. In the second case,
the sum power is minimized under zero-outage estimation distortion
constraint, and some related energy efficiency issues in sensor
networks are discussed.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) deploy geographically-distributed
sensor nodes to collect information of interest. The collected
information is usually aggregated via wireless transmissions at a
fusion center to generate the final intelligence. A typical wireless
sensor network, as shown in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Estimation Diversity and Energy Efficiency in Distributed Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, consists of a
fusion center and a number of sensors. The sensors typically have
limited energy resources and communication capability. Each sensor
in the network makes an observation of the quantity of interest,
generates a local signal (either analog or digital), and then sends
it to the fusion center where the received sensor signals are
combined to produce a final estimate of the observed quantity.
Sensor networks of this type are suited for various applications
such as environmental monitoring and smart factory instrumentation.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There has been a long history on the study of distributed
estimation. Examples of early work include the study in the context
of distributed control <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, tracking
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, or data fusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Recently, many new
results appear in the WSN community with a focus on distributed data
fusion, where the most commonly used network fusion model is the one
where each sensor processes its individual measurement and transmits
the result over a Multiple Access Channel (MAC) to the fusion
center. From an information-theoretic perspective,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> investigate the mean
squared estimation error performance versus transmit power for the
quadratic CEO problem with a coherent MAC. Notably, it is shown in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> that if the sensor statistics are Gaussian, a
simple uncoded (analog-and-forwarding) scheme dramatically
outperforms the separate source-channel coding approach and leads to
an optimal asymptotic scaling behavior. The uncoded communication
scheme is further proved to preserve the optimal scaling law
in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> for sensor networks with node statistics
satisfying a certain mean condition, while the source-channel
matching result is extended to more general homogeneous signal
fields in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. If the sensor measurements are not
continuous but in a finite alphabet, type-based transmission schemes
are proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The many-to-one
transport capacity and compressibility are investigated for dense
joint estimation sensor networks in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. When a
full coordination among sensors is unavailable and the underlying
communication links are not reliable, the distributed estimation
problem is investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, where an
information-theoretic achievable rate-distortion region is elegantly
derived.
The work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> studies the in-network processing
approaches based on a hierarchical data-handling and communication
architecture for the estimation of field sources. In addition, by
assuming only local sensor information exchange, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>
proposes a distributed algorithm for reaching network-wide
consensus.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Among most of the existing studies, it is usually assumed that the
joint distribution of the sensor observations is known. However, in
some practical systems the probability density function (pdf) of the
observation noise is hard to characterize, especially for a large
scale sensor network. This motivates us to devise universal signal
processing algorithms that do not require the knowledge of the
observation noise distributions. Recently, universal Decentralized
Estimation Schemes (DESs) are proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>
and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the author considers the universal
distributed estimation in a homogeneous sensor network where sensors
have observations of the same quality, while in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>, the
universal DES in an inhomogeneous sensing environment is considered.
These proposed DESs require each sensor to send to the fusion center
a short discrete message with length determined by the local Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR), which then guarantees that the performance is
within a constant factor of that achieved by the Best Linear
Unbiased Estimator (BLUE). An assumption in these proposed schemes
is that the channels between the sensors and the fusion center are
perfect, <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">i.e.</em>, all messages are received by the fusion center without
any distortion. However, due to power limitations, fading, and
channel noise, the signal sent by each individual sensor to the
fusion center may be corrupted. Therefore, the transmission system
for the joint estimation scheme should be designed to minimize the
end-to-end distortion subject to certain transmit power constraints,
under a practical wireless channel model considering both fading and
additive noises. In this paper we show that in a fading wireless
environment, multiple sensor nodes are not only necessary for
generating multiple observations to reduce distortion, but also
crucial to achieve a certain degree of diversity that minimizes the
effects of fading during signal transmissions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">If the sensor observation is in analog form, we have two main
options to transmit the observations from sensors to the fusion
center: analog or digital. For the analog approach, the observed
signal is transmitted via analog modulation to the fusion center,
which we refer to as the amplify-and-forward approach. In the
digital approach, the observed signal is digitized into bits,
possibly compressed and/or encoded, then digitally modulated and
transmitted. It is well known (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>) that
for a single Gaussian source with an Additive White Gaussian Noise
(AWGN) channel, both the digital and analog approaches can retain
the optimal power-distortion tradeoff. Also for the estimation of a
Gaussian source with a coherent Gaussian MAC, it is shown in
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> that the analog forwarding
schemes outperform (or are as good as) the digital approaches and
have the optimal asymptotic scaling behavior.
For sources with general distributions, type-based (each sensor
transmits the local type or histogram of its data in an analog
fashion over a MAC) parametric estimation schemes are proposed
in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
In the above papers, the impact of coherent MAC schemes on the joint
source-channel optimality is discussed.

</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, instead of assuming a coherent MAC, we adopt
orthogonal channels between the sensors and the fusion center. The
main motivation for using orthogonal multiple access schemes such as
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) is the removal of the
requirement on the carrier-level synchronization among sensors (we
still require pair-wise synchronization between each sensor and the
fusion center). We assume that the observed signal is analog and the
observation noises are uncorrelated across sensors. In addition, we
assume that the second moments of the signal and noise are known to
the corresponding sensor and the fusion center. The fusion center
deploys the best linear unbiased estimator to generate estimates of
the unknown signal. In this setting, we investigate an analog
transmission system where observations are amplified and forwarded
to the fusion center. We first analyze the system performance in
fading channels by introducing the concept of estimation diversity.
We investigate the diversity gain that is achievable in a slow
fading environment, where it is assumed that the transmission
between sensors and the fusion center experiences i.i.d. fading
factors together with AWGNs. An outage is claimed if the end-to-end
distortion is larger than a certain threshold. In this case, we show
that using multiple sensors can achieve diversity to enhance the
outage performance, where the diversity order is equal to the total
number of sensors. We then find the optimal power allocation
strategy for the case where the end-to-end distortion is minimized
under certain transmit power constraints. The result leads to
turning off certain sensors with bad channels and bad observation
quality. By doing so, the achievable diversity order is not reduced
and extra adaptive power gain is obtained. We finally investigate
the converse problem to minimize the total power consumption under a
certain distortion constraint.</p>

the system model. Section III analyzes the distortion performance of
an equal-power transmission strategy, where the concept of
estimation diversity is introduced. Section IV addresses the case
where the transmission power is allocated in an optimal way to
minimize the distortion. Section V focuses on the converse case
where power is minimized subject to a distortion constraint. Section
VI summarizes the results and presents our conclusions.</p>

investigating how the overall distortion performance is affected by
the fact that we have multiple sensors with independent fading

we increase the number of sensors given independent observations and

<p id="S3.p14.9" class="ltx_p">The outage probability versus the total transmission power is

we see that the 3-node case performs much better than the 1-node
case and the 9-node case performs much better than the 3-node case.
Approximately, when the logarithm of outage probability is plotted
versus the logarithm of total transmission power, the slope of the
curve at the high power region is proportional to the number of
sensors, which is defined as the diversity order in
Eq. (<a href="#S3.E8" title="In III equal-power Allocation: Estimation Diversity ‣ Estimation Diversity and Energy Efficiency in Distributed Sensing" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">8</span></a>). Note that this definition of
diversity order is based on the distortion outage performance, which
is different from the traditional definition of diversity order in
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) multi-antenna
systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>, which is usually the slope of symbol error
curves. However, the two definitions imply similar performance

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In the previous section we showed that diversity gain can be
achieved even if we use a simple uniform power allocation scheme. In
this section, we optimize power allocation among the sensors to
minimize the total distortion. The diversity performance is analyzed
and we show that a certain adaptive power gain can be achieved by
optimal power control. To clarify the analysis, we first
discuss the problem with only a sum power constraint, then discuss
the general case with both sum and individual power constraints.

the optimal power transmission schemes, and compare it with the

constraint is imposed to guarantee a fair comparison when we change
the number of sensor nodes. In some application scenarios, this sum
power constraint has a physical meaning. For example, let us assume
that there are multiple clusters of sensors, where each cluster is
performing a different observation task. If different clusters are
sharing the same frequency band to transmit information, the total
power emitted from each cluster must be limited to enable the
coexistence of multiple clusters. In addition, a more severe power
constraint may be imposed on each individual sub-band used by each
sensor for better frequency reuse, which is modeled by individual
power constraints for all the sensors. Note that the individual
power constraint may also be imposed by power supply characteristics
at each node.</p>

equal-power and optimal power transmission strategies, while in the
latter case we can further achieve certain adaptive power gain. In
this section, we discuss a converse problem. Given a set of channel
gains, which may be one realization of Rayleigh fading or may be
simply caused by different transmission distances, we seek the
optimal power allocation scheme to minimize the total power
consumption while satisfying a certain distortion requirement. If
the distortion requirement is satisfied with minimum power
consumption for each given channel realization, we call such a
scheme as minimum-power estimation with zero outage.</p>

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the distributed estimation of an unknown source, we have
introduced a new concept of estimation outage and defined the
corresponding estimation diversity, for the case of i.i.d.
observation noise variances at different sensors and i.i.d. fading
channels between the sensors and the fusion center. We have shown
that the full estimation diversity (on the order of the number of
sensor nodes <math id="S6.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="K" display="inline"><semantics id="S6.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">K</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S6.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝐾</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S6.p1.1.m1.1c">K</annotation></semantics></math>) can be achieved even with simple equal-power
transmission strategies. We have further shown that the end-to-end
distortion can be minimized under sum power constraints, where we
gain certain adaptive power gain on top of the full diversity gain
by turning off sensors with bad channels and bad observation
quality. Moreover, we demonstrated that by considering an extra
individual power constraint at each sensor, certain performance loss
occurs. Minimum-power transmission with zero estimation outage has
also been investigated, where significant power savings is achieved
over equal-power transmission schemes.</p>
