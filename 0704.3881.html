<p id="id3.id1" class="ltx_p">A unified approach to energy-efficient power control is proposed for
code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks. The approach is applicable
to a large family of multiuser receivers including the matched
filter, the decorrelator, the linear minimum mean-square error
(MMSE) receiver, and the (nonlinear) optimal detectors. It exploits the linear relationship
that has been shown to exist between the transmit power and the
output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SIR) in the
large-system limit. It is shown that, for this family of
receivers, when users seek to selfishly maximize their own energy
efficiency, the Nash equilibrium is SIR-balanced. In addition, a
unified power control (UPC) algorithm for reaching the Nash
equilibrium is proposed. The algorithm adjusts the user’s transmit
powers by iteratively computing the large-system multiuser
efficiency, which is independent of instantaneous spreading
sequences. The convergence of the algorithm is proved for the
matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is
demonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector.
Moreover, the performance of the algorithm in finite-size systems
is studied and compared with that of a conventional power control
scheme, in which user powers depend on the instantaneous spreading
sequences.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Power control is used for interference management and resource
allocation in both the downlink and the uplink of
code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>.
In particular,
in the uplink each user transmits just enough
power to achieve the required quality of service (QoS) without
causing excessive interference in the network.
In recent years, power
control for multiuser receivers has attracted much attention
due to their
superior performance as compared to the
single-user matched filter. For example, power control algorithms for the linear minimum
mean-square error (MMSE) receiver and successive interference
cancellation receivers have been proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>, respectively. In the proposed schemes, the
output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SIR) of each is
measured and then the user’s transmit power is
adjusted to achieve the desired SIR.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Power control is conventionally modeled as an optimization problem under some quality of service (QoS) constraints.
A practically appealing scheme is to minimize
the total transmit power under the constraint that the output SIR of each user is above some lower bound.
Under reasonable assumptions it is shown that
the total transmit power is minimized
when the SIR requirements are met with equality <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Another approach
is to choose the transmit powers in such a way as to
maximize the spectral efficiency (in bits/s/Hz) of the network,
where the optimal strategy is essentially a
water-filling scheme <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In recent years, game
theory has been used to study power control in CDMA networks. In particular, power control can be modeled as a non-cooperative
game in which each user selfishly maximizes its own utility. The
strategy chosen by one user affects the performance of other users
in the network through multiple-access interference
(e.g.,
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>).</p>

studies the cross-layer design problem of joint power
control and multiuser detection using game theory.
The utility function in this
case measures the number of bits transmitted per joule of energy
consumed, which is particularly suitable for
energy-constrained networks. Focusing on linear receivers, the
Nash equilibrium for the non-cooperative game has been derived. A Nash
equilibrium refers to a set of strategies for which no user can
unilaterally improve its own utility <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>.
It is also shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> that for all
linear receivers, the transmit powers of the
users are SIR-balanced at Nash equilibrium
(i.e., all users have the same output SIR).</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This work extends the results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> to a much
larger family of receivers (including nonlinear ones) in the
so-called <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">large-system</span> regime, where the number of users and
the spreading factor are large with a given ratio. This is due to
results in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> where a linear relationship between the
input power and the output SIR is shown to exist for a family of
multiuser detectors in the large-system limit. Members of this
family include well-known receivers such as the matched filter
(MF), the decorrelator (DEC), the linear MMSE receiver, as well as
the individually optimal (IO) and jointly optimal (JO) multiuser
detectors.<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>The individually optimal detector minimizes
the error probability of detecting an individual symbol whereas

often referred to as the maximum likelihood (ML) detector.</span></span></span> By
exploiting the linear relationship, which is characterized by the
multiuser efficiency, we propose a unified power control (UPC)
algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium.
The convergence of the
proposed algorithm is proved for linear receivers and is
demonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector.

</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Since the UPC algorithm is
based on large-system results, it does not depend on the
instantaneous spreading sequences.
The true SIR, however, does depend on the spreading sequences.
Therefore, the SIR achieved by the UPC algorithm deviates from the
target SIR as the spreading sequence changes from one
symbol to the next. This in turn will result in a loss in the
utility. The performance of the UPC algorithm in finite-size
systems is studied and it is shown that if the spreading factor is
reasonably large, the SIR achieved by the UPC algorithm stays
close to the target SIR most of the time which means that the loss
is insignificant. </p>

The above algorithm is applicable to
a large family of receivers which includes many popular receivers
such as the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE
detector as well as the individually and jointly optimal multiuser
detectors. Note, for example, that for a matched filter receiver,
the UPC algorithm becomes the same as the bilinear power control
algorithm proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> for minimizing the SIR error.

a large-system approach and hence independent of the spreading
sequences. Therefore, after convergence, the transmit powers need
not be updated as long as the channel gains remain static.
Evidently, the actual SIRs depend on the spreading sequences (see
for example (<a href="#S2.E5" title="In II-A System Model and Multiuser Detection ‣ II Multiuser Detection and Power Control ‣ A Unified Approach to Energy-Efficient Power Control in Large CDMA SystemsThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants ANI-03-38807 and CCF-0644344, as well as by DARPA under Grant W911NF-07-1-0028.

Consequently, as the spreading sequence changes, the output SIRs
achieved by the UPC algorithm fluctuate around the target SIR.
This fluctuation results in a loss in energy efficiency (see

It is also observed
that the steady-state transmit powers for the decorrelator and the
MMSE receiver are close to those of the ML detector (in this case,
the difference is less than 22%). This means that in terms of
energy efficiency, which is quantified by the utility achieved at
Nash equilibrium, the decorrelator and the MMSE receiver are
almost as good as the ML detector.</p>

The plots show CDFs obtained from simulation
(based on 100,000 realizations) as well as those predicted by the
theoretical approximations given in Section <a href="#S5" title="V Performance Evaluation and Discussion ‣ A Unified Approach to Energy-Efficient Power Control in Large CDMA SystemsThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants ANI-03-38807 and CCF-0644344, as well as by DARPA under Grant W911NF-07-1-0028.

It
is seen from the figures that the theoretical approximations
become more accurate as the spreading factor increases. Also,
the approximations are generally more accurate when the system load
is low.
Note that, for the decorrelator, the
approximation based on a beta distribution is slightly more
accurate than the one based on a Gaussian distribution, especially
for small spreading factors and large system loads.

in the output SIR results in 10% loss in the user’s utility. The
probabilities obtained by simulation suggest that the UPC
algorithm performs better for the MMSE receiver than for the
decorrelator. It is also seen from the table that when the
spreading factor is small, the fluctuations in the output SIR are

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A unified approach to energy-efficient power control in large
systems is proposed, which is applicable to a large family of
linear and nonlinear multiuser receivers. The approach exploits
the linear relationship between the transmit power and the output
SIR in large systems. Taking a non-cooperative game-theoretic
approach with emphasis on energy efficiency, it is shown that the
Nash equilibrium is SIR-balanced not only for linear receivers but
also for some nonlinear receivers such as the individually and
jointly optimal multiuser detectors. In addition, a unified power
control algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium is proposed.
It would be straightforward to extend the unified approach to
multirate and multicarrier systems based on related large-system
results <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>.</p>
