on the assessment and propagation of input uncertainty for option
pricing when using tree-based methods. Input uncertainty is
propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting that
option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on.
Option pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional
not only on how close the model represents reality, but also on
the quality of the inputs they use, and those inputs are usually
not observable. We provide three alternative frameworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating
parameter uncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our
methods with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options market established. These methods can
be applied to pricing of instruments for which there is not an
options market, as well as a methodological tool to account for
parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.</span></p>

Pricing models and algorithms, ranging from the now-basic Black &amp;
Scholes (1973) to more complex Partial Integro Differential
Equations (PIDE) (Cont et al., 2004) and tree-based methods (Cox
et al., (1979), Gustafsson et al., (2002)) are being proposed
continuously in what has become a very extensive
literature in mathematical finance. </span>

<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">All these option pricing models rely on some set of inputs, obtained
by either estimation (Polson et al., (2003)) or calibration (Cont et
al., (2004)) to implied market values, with most of them relying on
no-arbitrage arguments. Garcia et al., (2003) provides a good econometric review. </span>

<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">Once a set of input values is determined, they are passed to complex
mathematical functions, whenever closed-form solutions are
available, or computational algorithms to determine anything from
plain vanilla to very exotic option prices. This common framework
provides, in most cases, a unique solution, a unique option price
that practitioners consider the theoretical, risk-neutral value of
the option, and around which the market players will add the risk
premium and spread. However, throughout all this process, we must
not forget that the quality of such output relies extremely on the
quality of the inputs used.</span></p>

<p id="S1.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">In most cases, a key input, expressed one way or another, is the
volatility of the underlying asset (or combination of assets) that
defines the option. The realized volatility literature (Andersen
et al., 2003) has brought us closer to making this parameter
locally observable at higher frequencies. Some problems still
persist such as the lack of data, and the existence of other
parameters (nuisance parameters), which render the task of making
accurate assessments of our uncertainty about inputs for option
pricing models more difficult. In practice, it is common to use
the most likely input values or calibrated input values to price
options, and focus the efforts on good modelling of parameter dynamics.</span></p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">During the last few years, there have been many advances in the
modelling of the underlying (stochastic volatility (Jacquier et al.,
(1994)), jump-diffusion models (Duffie et al., (2000))) and/or
modelling jointly the underlying and the observed options movements
(Eraker et al., 2003, Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2001)).
However, no matter how accurate our models become to estimate
unobservable inputs, a proper accounting of their flaws and pitfalls
as well as assessment of input uncertainty is as important to option
pricing as the quality of the pricing model itself. Propagation of
input uncertainty through complex mathematical model output
uncertainty has been explored in other fields, like traffic
engineering (Molina et al., 2005) or climatology (Coles and Pericchi
(2003)).</span></p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">The focus of this paper is the assessment and propagation of input
uncertainty, and its effects on option pricing through the
computation of a posterior distribution of the option prices,
conditional on the observed data, that we use to integrate out the
parameter’s uncertainty from the option functional. That is, we look for
option prices that are unconditional from the parameters they rely on.
We illustrate
this idea through an alternative way to calibrate a tree-based model.
By using the historical returns of the underlying, and
looking at the up/down returns with respect to the risk-free rate,
but by using a related statistical parametric approach, we not only from the
sample variation of the up/down returns, but also from the scale
and location parameters from the return probability generating
process as well. As time passes by, we are able to observe more
returns, and adjust our knowledge about the parameters (assuming that they are constant).
We undertake a bayesian approach to the modelling and the estimation of the underlying (Hastings (1970)).
Parameter posterior distributions lead us to posterior
probabilities on the trees that we use afterwards to price
options. However, our goal is not to provide a better pricing
model but a new method to estimate model parameters and propagate
parameter uncertainty through the use of Bayesian methods,
illustrating how uncertainty of inputs can be reflected into
uncertainty of outputs. Therefore, we confine our application to the
tree-based classic approach of Cox et al., (1979), and build a statistical
model that accounts for input uncertainty, and propagate it into
option price uncertainty under the framework set by that model.//
In sections two and three we motivate
our approach to assessment and propagation of input uncertainty
into pricing model outputs together with a basic
decision-theoretic argument, and show that most likely parameter
values do not necessarily lead to optimal option price reference
choices. In section four we propose a statistical method for the
estimation of such input uncertainty and construct the link
between the statistical model, input uncertainty and the
Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) model. Section five contains an
application of this method for the S&amp;P500 as well as a comparison
with bootstrap-based calibrations of the tree model, together with
potential further applications in section 6. Finally, section 7
concludes. We will consider throughout the paper the situation where there
are no options markets in place to produce a better calibration, and option prices
must be developed solely from the information contained in the underlying instrument.

difference for option pricing? After all, if we fit a model to the
most likely values through classical maximum likelihood methods, we
should be as close as we can to the ”true” option theoretical,
risk-neutral value by the invariance principle of the MLE estimator
(assuming one-to-one relationships between input and output).
Furthermore, most practitioners want a simple, unique answer as to
what the market price should be.</span></p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">There are four major reasons why we might not know the true value
of an option: First, our model might incorrectly represent the
dynamics of the underlying (Cont, R. (2006)) leading to incorrect
and biased option prices. We choose to ignore model uncertainty in
this paper (understanding models as different pricing tools, and not as different
trees), although it should be accounted for through the use of
model averaging approaches (Hoeting et al., (1999), Cont, R.
(2006)). Second, even if our option pricing model was correct, the
option’s payoff is random. However, we can price the latter under
risk-neutral assumptions. Third, which is the focus of our paper,
even if the model was correct, the model parameters are not known,
and different combinations of inputs lead to different values of the
option. Finally, when we have more than one parameter defining the trees, the one-to-one relationship
between parameters and option prices breaks down.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">The true value of options is not in terms of actual discounted
payoffs, but in terms of expected ones. For example, the value of a
digital option is either zero or some fixed amount, depending on the
path of the underlying until maturity, but what we try to model is
the expected value of that option as of today. The theoretical value
of the option will be considered known if we were to know the exact
value of the inputs that drive the underlying, but not the realized
path of the underlying. When pricing options, the most we can aspire
to learn from the dynamics of the underlying are the model
parameters, as the path will remain stochastic. That is why we
define ”value” of an option at a given period only in terms of the
risk-neutral valuation based on the true, unknown inputs. Even if
the model accurately represents the dynamics of the underlying, the
model parameters are still unknown. This is especially true as we
construct more complicated models, where parameters could not only
be dynamic but stochastic as well, and even an infinite amount of
data would not suffice to learn about their future values.</span></p>

<div id="S2.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S2.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">It is common for practitioners to price options by using the mode of
the inputs’ probability distributions (eg most likely value of the
volatility). A first glitch comes when mapping a multi-dimensional
input parameter vector into a 1-dimensional output, as the most
likely value of the input does not necessarily lead to the most
likely value of the output. This is a strong argument in favor of
finding approaches that reflect actual parameter uncertainty. All we
want to know is an option s most likely value? Perhaps its value
based on the most likely input? What about its expected value? If we
obtain the option price’s probability distribution, we can extract
much more information, including but not restricted to all those.</span></p>

to the ”true” option value, nor to the expected/optimal option
value. The most likely value of the parameter has probability zero
of being the true value in continuous parameter spaces. This is
quite important, since option prices are asymmetric with respect to
most of their inputs, making the effect on the option price of a small parameter error
in either direction very different.</span></p>

In other words, our focus
changes from how much we know (most likely value) to how much we do
not know (probability distribution). In general a unique option
value deprives us from a full assessment of the uncertainty in
option valuation. It is not the same to know that the option price
is with 99% probability between 40 and 42 than if it is between 37
and 45, even if in both cases the expected and most likely values
happened to be the same. Market players will act differently on
those two cases. This happens when the option value is asymmetric,
as we will show later in the paper.</span></p>

CRR model in this paper. This has several advantages. First, it
allows for prior information to be naturally included whenever
available. This is especially useful in situations where the data
is scarce, distributions vary over time or we cannot rely on
asymptotics for calibration. Second, it provides a natural way to
account for uncertainty in the parameters after we observe the
underlying’s historical return series, and the necessary dynamic
updating as new information becomes available. The posterior
distribution of parameters given the data fits conceptually well
into this framework, allowing to sequentially update and learn

<p id="S4.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">We chose a mixture of truncated gaussian for several reasons. First we wanted to mimic the assumptions of the options
model we use, which force the existence of two kinds of
observations: positive, defined as those above the risk-free, and
negative, defined as those below the risk-free. This naturally
brings the idea of a mixture of truncated densities. However, the
inherent uncertainty about the values of those, together with the
fact that in reality we don’t simply observe two single values for
the series, suggests that the realized positive and negative
values do come from some mixture, with the truncation at the point
of division between the ups and downs (the risk-free). We allowed
different variances for the positive and negative parts to account
for possible skewness in the data, potential bubbles and other
non-symmetric market behaviors. Finally our choice of gaussian
distributions just came from trying to keep the choices simple.</span></p>

<p id="S4.SS4.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S4.SS4.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">We could in principle have added further layers of complication to
the model (e.g. mixtures of t-distributions, markov switching
behavior or even stochastic volatility or jumps), but decided to
keep things simple, as our target, again, is not a better pricing
model, but a method for a more accurate description of the involved
uncertainties. All these extensions are tractable, because the
statistical model is fully constructed on the physical measure, and
plenty of estimation algorithms are available for these potential
extensions. The extent of divergence in the final output is,
indeed, an interesting topic in itself, but we will focus here on procedures for propagating uncertainty.</span>

uncertainty about the inputs and how this propagates into
uncertainty about the call price output. Second, they show that
the call price is skewed, as also observed by Karolyi (1993). This
shows us that even the most likely value of the actual output is
not necessarily the most representative one. Under the three
methods we obtain similar results with different levels of
uncertainty as shown in table 1. Third, we should note that this
valuation is still being done under a risk-neutral approach, so
the actual call market price is (much) larger than one would
expect under risk neutrality. This by no means invalidates the
risk-neutral approach, but allows us a better perception and even
quantification of the extent of the risk premia in the market as
well as empirically the considerable overpricing (underpricing) of
in-the-money (out-of-the-money) options (MacBeth and Merville
(1979), Rubinstein (1985)). Our work differs from Karolyi (1993)
since our bayesian analysis is performed for a greater class of
stochastic processes as limits in continuous time, than the
classical geometric brownian motion as treated in Karolyi (1993),
which is a special case.</span></p>

represent the call market prices (points) as we move closer to
maturity (vertical line). The x-axis represents time, and as we
move towards the right we get closer to the maturity date of that
call. The two lines represent the 0.5% and 99.5% percentiles for
the posterior distribution of the call prices, at each point in
time. We have run the MCMC analysis on a rolling basis for the
three methods based on the information available until each time
point, computing the Monte Carlo-based percentiles for each
posterior sample, and those lines represent the 99% credible
intervals for the call prices for each period until maturity.
Several interesting things can be extracted from these
plots:</span>

<div id="S5.SS1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">First, we can see that the range of the 99% credible interval gets
narrower as we get closer to maturity. We can see this more clearly
in the top-right plot, where we see that range size over time. We
should expect to be more certain about where the call price should
be as we get closer to maturity, since any uncertainty we might have
about the inputs will have a smaller impact. This is more evident
for smooth payoffs, where small differences in the inputs only
become large differences in payoffs if there is a long time to
maturity. The overall extent of the input uncertainty will be a
function of time, so this
methodology is specially suitable for options with longer maturities.</span>

<div id="S5.SS1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">Second, we can see the gap between the credible interval and the
actual market price. This gap, which represents the risk premium
for the call in the market, gets smaller as we get closer to
maturity. The markets are adding a larger nominal spread for
larger maturities, which is reasonable, since larger maturity
implies larger uncertainty and larger risks associated with the
instrument. We can see this more clearly in the bottom-right plot,
where we see the risk premium over time, expressed as market call
price minus expected call price under the posterior (points) or
market call price minus 99% percentile under the posterior
(line). In all three cases, as we get closer to maturity, the risk
premium goes to
zero.</span>

<p id="S5.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">Third, we can see that whenever there is a jump in the underlying,
a strong movement in the market, the risk premium tends to
increase. The bottom-left plot represents the underlying (points)
versus the strike (line). For example, we can see that there is a
strong price movement on the 42nd point. The underlying falls
rapidly, and at the same time, we can see in the top left plot how
both the market call price and the credible interval move
accordingly. What is more interesting is the behavior of these
during this period. First, we can see that the credible interval
has a wider range at that point (top-left plot), showing a larger
uncertainty about the true call price. Second, we can see that the
actual market risk premium increases in figures

<p id="S5.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S5.SS1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="font-size:90%;">We only need to run one MCMC analysis per instrument and time
period. The MCMC algorithm can be partitioned and parallelized, as
we mention in the appendix. However, the major advantage comes from
the Monte Carlo step, where we can indeed fully parallelize the
algorithm to compute the (iid) Monte Carlo samples. This is
especially useful if there were time constraints in the pricing
and/or the pricing algorithm was slow. In any case, the level of
precision required will be the determining factor of the actual
speed of the algorithm. In our example, it took a few seconds to run
each MCMC step, and the major computational cost came from the Monte
Carlo step for options with very long maturities, as it takes longer
to price the tree. Still the algorithm is quite tractable and simple
to code, and we feel the additional computational burden is very
limited compared to the additional information it provides. Of
course, for closed-form pricing models, these steps are even more
trivial and quick to construct.</span></p>

some instrument and linked that data to the parameters of the option
pricing formula through a statistical model. We then have proceeded
to estimate these parameters and pass the uncertainty about them,
through the pricing formula, into uncertainty about the outputs. It
is worth noting that at no point we needed to use implied or options
market prices to do this. Therefore, this method has a very natural
use in pricing of instruments for which there is not an options
market defined, and for which calibration-based methods that use
options prices fail to provide an answer (Rubinstein, M. (1994)).
This is the case for most real options (Mun, J. (2005)), as well as
client-specific options for which we might want to make a market or

This distribution,
together with the observed underlying returns, allows computation
of profit and loss distribution of the derivative. Also, it is
worth noticing that the option pricing statistical link that we
have developed throughout this paper can be expanded and enhanced.
Several improvements could include modelling the variance of the
returns of the ups and downs through two stochastic volatility
models (Jacquier et al., 1994), or modelling truncated t-students
instead of truncated normals.</span></p>

more adequate to use the whole posterior distributions from model

proceeded to show the effects of parameter uncertainty into model
outputs and how this should be considered as a joint problem when
defining option pricing tools. The link between the pricing tools

suffers from low sample sizes, hindering the ability to create
bootstrapped intervals that would make the estimation of the tail

sample, the bootstrap method and our approach provided similar
results. However, the use of a bayesian approach (parametric
and/or nonparametric) is more appealing when in presence of low
sample sizes, and where prior process or parameter knowledge can
be incorporated into the analysis. Simple variations would allow
parameter learning, which would be of special relevance on
overly-trending markets, as well as computing theoretical option
values when the historical data on the underlying and option
prices are quite small.</span></p>

To set these
variance we allow a pre-burn-in period. We monitor the acceptance
ratios for the Metropolis algorithm over this period, and adjust the
variance up or down to reach a target Metropolis acceptance ratio
between 10% and 50%. Then, after we reach this ratio for all
parameters, we fix
that variance and allow the MCMC to start in its regular form.</span>

it allows the user a more black-box approach, where the algorithm
will adjust itself to reach an acceptable mixing of the chain.
Therefore, it requires less user inputs to run, making it more
automatic and appealing for practitioners. Second, it makes most
of the actual metropolis ratios in the sampling algorithm simpler,
as the contributions of the proposals cancel on numerator and
denominator, due to the symmetry of the proposal
